# vistorrent
A lightweight torrenting client built in Go with the main goal of gaining a deeper understanding of torrenting! **Not recommended for üåäüö¢üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è**

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- Git
- Golang

### Installation & Execution

## Demo

Each red box represents a piece of a file, when that piece has been downloaded, it turns green! If a peer fails to download a piece, it is placed back onto the work queue (hence the appearance of "missed" red boxes in the demo)

## Future Plans
- Support for magnet links (currently only supports `.torrent` files)
- Support for other tracker types and/or a [distributed hash table](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html) (currently only supports HTTP trackers)
- Support for multi-file torrents (currently only supports single-file torrents)
- Support for seeding (currently only supports leeching)
- Make visualization optional and use a desktop application instead of a web application
