# vistorrent
A lightweight torrenting client built in Go with the main goal of gaining a deeper understanding of torrenting! **Not recommended for 🌊🚢🏴‍☠️**

### Future Plans
- Support for magnet links (currently only supports `.torrent` files)
- Support for other tracker types and/or a [distributed hash table](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html) (currently only supports HTTP trackers)
- Support for multi-file torrents (currently only supports single file torrents)
- Support for seeding (currently only supports leeching)
